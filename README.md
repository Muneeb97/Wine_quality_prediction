# Wine_quality_prediction
Predicting the quality of wine based on some variables using Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor

The Red_wine_tnsr.ipynb file was used for experimenting the use of a DNNClassifier with the hidden layers ->[10,10,10,10,10,6]. The resulting evaluation metrics were rather poor so the approach was discarded. This might have been due to using a linear classifier with low amount of data and setting categorical labels.
